# ByteCamp-IOT
This is a project created and implemented for ByteCamp 2017- Library Management System<br>
The Library Management System has a hardware module(RPi) which scans barcodes on Student ID cards(their PRN numbers) 
as well as the barcodes on the books(ISBN code) they want to issue.
This two step procedure takes care of issuing book, returning books and identifying late return.

ZBar (https://github.com/ZBar/ZBar) was used for barcode detection.
